This is a final project from NCKU Taiwan, and we modify the  HyperNet: Self-Supervised Hyperspectral SpatialSpectral Feature Understanding Network for Hyperspectral Change Detection
from IEEE TGRS paper to achieve better performance by adding transformer encoder, very thank to the author release the code to  implement HyperNet

Our other peer methods and source codes are from as follows:

1.MSDFFN :Multi-scale Diff-Changed Feature Fusion Network for Hyper spectral Image Change Detection (IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING, VOL. 61, 2023 )
https://github.com/Zhoutya/ChangeDetection-MSDFFN

2.CSANet: Cross-Temporal Interaction Symmetric Attention Network for Hyperspectral Image Change Detection (IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS, VOL. 19, 2022 )
https://github.com/SYFYN0317/CSANet

3.SST-Former:Spectral–Spatial–Temporal Transformers for Hyperspectral Image Change Detection (IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING, VOL. 60, 2022)

https://github.com/yanhengwang-heu/IEEE_TGRS_SSTFormer

We use the baseline transformer from:
4.Hyperspectral Unmixing Using Transformer Network(IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING, VOL. 60, 2022)
https://github.com/preetam22n/DeepTrans-HSU

and use linear transform tokenization by ourself. We only modify HyperNet and the others methods is the same, so we only upload our modified version HyerNet code.
Many thanks to the above authors for their paper and code to help us to accomplish
